# Guess_The_Number
This is my first project.
It asks you for your name and the highest number you can guess.
After you typed this in, you have to guess. You don't have infinite guesses.
When you guessed the number, it tells you how many guesses you needed and the right number.
If you dont guess the number after certain guesses, it'll tell that you didn't guess the right number and it'll tell you the right number.
